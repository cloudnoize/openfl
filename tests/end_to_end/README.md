# End-to-end Pytest Framework

This project aims at integration testing of ```openfl-workspace``` using pytest framework.

## Test Structure

```
tests/end_to_end
├── models                  # Central location for all model-related code for testing purpose
├── test_suites             # Folder containing test files
├── utils                   # Folder containing fixture and helper files
├── conftest.py             # Pytest framework configuration file
├── pytest.ini              # Pytest initialisation file
└── README.md               # Readme file
```

** File `sample_tests.py` provided under `test_suites` acts as a reference on how to add a new test case.

## Pre-requisites

1. Setup virtual environment and install OpenFL using [online documentation](https://openfl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).
2. Ensure that the OpenFL workspace (inside openfl-workspace) is present for the model being tested. If not, create it first.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies on above virtual environment, run:

```sh
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run a specific test case, use below command:

```sh
python -m pytest -s tests/end_to_end/test_suites/<test_case_filename> -k <test_case_name>
```

** -s will ensure all the logs are printed on screen. Ignore, if not required.

Below parameters are available for modification:

1. --num_collaborators <int>   - to modify the number of collaborators
2. --num_rounds <int>          - to modify the number of rounds to train
3. --model_name <str>          - to use a specific model
4. --disable_tls               - to disable TLS communication (by default it is enabled)
5. --disable_client_auth       - to disable the client authentication (by default it is enabled)

For example, to run Task runner (bare metal approach) with - torch/mnist model, 3 collaborators, 5 rounds and non-TLS scenario:

```sh
python -m pytest -s tests/end_to_end/test_suites/task_runner_tests.py -m task_runner_basic --num_rounds 5 --num_collaborators 3 --model_name torch/mnist --disable_tls
```

And, to run Task runner (via dockerized workspace) with keras/mnist, 2 collaborators, 3 rounds:

```sh
python -m pytest -s tests/end_to_end/test_suites/task_runner_tests.py -m task_runner_dockerized_ws --num_rounds 3 --num_collaborators 2 --model_name keras/mnist
```

### Fixture and marker mapping:

- `fx_federation_tr` - for task_runner_basic
- `fx_federation_tr_dws` - for task_runner_dockerized_ws
